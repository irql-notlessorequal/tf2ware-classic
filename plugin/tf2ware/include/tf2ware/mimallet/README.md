# mimallet (Micro Mallet)

A local fork of [Mallet](https://github.com/irql-notlessorequal/Mallet) that is shrunk down for TF2Ware Classic,
removing un-needed code, reliance on GameData and making it work out-of-the-box on all installations.

This is included in all builds by default.

To opt-out and use regular Mallet, set `ENABLE_MALLET=1` as a build-time define.
