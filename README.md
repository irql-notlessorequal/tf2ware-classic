# TF2Ware Classic

The original TF2Ware from 2011, fixed up and working!

# Roadmap

- [x] Make the gamemode function again
- [x] Fix the player freeze issue during "Waiting For Players"
- [x] Drop the `gamedata.txt` requirement, making the gamemode 64-bit ready and immune to breakages.
- [ ] Bring back overhead scores
- [ ] Fix assorted issues with "!activator" (i.e. Kamikaze microgame)
- [ ] Rewrite the codebase, dropping the spaghetti code of the past.
- [ ] Fix the gamemode misbehaving when loading in the map.
- [ ] Fix the flood microgame killing you twice at higher speeds.
